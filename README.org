somewhere into your site.pp

For purposes of this provider, aliasname is MANDATORY and MUST BE
UNIQUE. Likewise MANDATORY are brand, image_uuid and, for the time
being, dns_doman and resolver.

ATTENTION: At the moment, for a successful creation, puppet agent
needs to be run two times - I do not know why
