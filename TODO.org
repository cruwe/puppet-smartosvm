  - [ ] needs to be decided if more than two NICs are reasonable and
        feasible for automatic creation.
        the problem is how to get the information from list command
        without knowing beforehand how many NICS exist 
- all properties "overkill" at the moment, necessary are
  - [X] nic_tag
  - [X] IP
  - [X] netmask
  - [X] gw
  - [ ] resolvers (array!)
  - [X] DHCP srv
- [X] add NIC
- [X] update NIC
- [ ] destroy NIC ???

- [ ] are all defaults sensible?

*** errors

- [X] max_swap without function, parameter -> property
